# retail.red plugin for Magento 1

This plugin enables merchants to easily offer click & reserve functionality in their Magento 1 Shop. 
It uses our [storefront javascript library](https://github.com/retail-red/storefront-library).
The script adds a “reserve” button to the product detail page, via which a new reservation can be placed.
